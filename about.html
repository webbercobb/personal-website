  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="lede"><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>

  <p>
    I make large-scale oil-stick works on canvas that deal with the performance, construction,
    and vulnerability of masculinity. The pieces draw on personal, queer, and archival source
    images—portraits, still lifes, and environments—then reduce them to essential shapes and
    tonal fields. My process balances speed and restraint: decisive mark-making layered over
    disciplined palettes derived from art history to keep the work emotionally charged without
    drifting into noise.
  </p>

  <p>
    I often begin by mapping light and shadow into simplified planes, then build in passes:
    ground, block-in, secondary depth, and final accents. Working quickly preserves a sense of
    immediacy; limiting the palette and locking composition keeps the image legible at scale.
    The goal is clarity with pressure—works that read in a room and deepen up close.
  </p>
